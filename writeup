open ports
port ssh 22
port http 80
http://10.10.11.143
the url shows no page so we execute the curl command
a x-backend  officer.paper shows in the header
so we should add it to etc/host to run it
the officer.paper appear and it s a cms wordpress
after a wpscan 
the version of this wordpress is vulnerable that allows an unauthenticated user to view private or draft posts due to an issue within WP_Query.
on exploit.db we find that we can access a secret page 
we add officer.paper/?static=1 and it shows a secret page that redirect us to a chat page
the chat dispalys a chatbot who has the right to list files and directories (role of a web shell)
after testing different files we found and .exe file (hubot)
after executing it we find the ssh password of the chatbot
so we connect to the ssh and we find a user.txt that displays the first flag
and we execute a python cve file that we found as well
and we have the root
